# WaiterMate

WaiterMate is a simple terminal-based application designed to streamline restaurant operations by digitizing the order-taking process. It allows waitstaff to take customer orders, send them to the kitchen staff digitally, and receive notifications when orders are ready. This eliminates the need for handwritten notes and manual communication, saving time and improving efficiency.

Features

Order Management
Take customer orders by table number.
View all active orders with their current status.

Kitchen Communication
Orders are sent directly to the kitchen queue.
Kitchen staff can mark orders as "Ready" and add optional notes if needed.

Waiter Notification
Waitstaff receive real-time updates when an order is marked as "Ready."

Error Handling
Validates inputs to ensure accurate order-taking.

How It Works

Taking Orders
Waitstaff enter the table number and order items into the app.
The order is stored in a shared queue for the kitchen.

Order Updates
Kitchen staff can view all pending orders and mark them as "Ready" when completed.

Notifications
Once an order is marked "Ready," the waiter is notified instantly to serve the order.
